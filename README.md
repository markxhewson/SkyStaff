A minecraft plugin that hooks into BungeeCord &amp; LuckPerms to display all servers, and their staff.

This plugin only hooks into LuckPerms and no other permissions plugin, you must have this plugin installed before attempting to use this plugin.

## Setup
Simply place the jar into your plugins folder, and then start & stop your server.

From there, a config file will generate, and you can configure it how you want.

Once you have finished configuring the file, you can then start the server to see the changes.
